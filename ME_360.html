            <strong>Design Objectives:</strong> The objective of this project was to design and construct a four-bar 
            linkage mechanism to function as an automated waste-dispensing system. Primary design constraints included 
            maintaining all pivot points within the supporting structure and limiting the coupler link rotation to a 
            maximum of 45° to prevent material spillage. Ultimately, the goal of this assignment was to gain hands-on 
            experience with kinematic analysis software and to develop familiarity with Grübler’s criterion for 
            determining degrees of freedom.

            <strong>Kinematic Analysis:</strong> The initial objective of this assignment was to model the given 
            problem statement in a two-dimensional kinematic simulator, specifically <i>Math Illustrations</i>. Using the 
            provided problem parameters, the initial and final positions of the coupler were defined and analyzed. 
            Due to the incompatibility of perpendicular bisector theory with the full coupler endpoints, connection 
            points were instead defined using variable references, and an intermediate position for these points was
            developed, as shown in the figure below. Pivot point locations were determined by the intersection 
            of the perpendicular bisections between the start, intermediate, and final positions of the tray.
            Distances <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> were determined to provide 
            sufficient clearance for the coupler and to position the crank arm beyond the coupler’s center of 
            gravity in order to avoid misconfiguration caused by a geometric singularity during collinearity of the
            crank and rocker links. Relevant dimensions of the system are presented in the table below.

            <strong>Solidworks Motion Analysis:</strong> Once calculated in <i>Math Illustrations</i>, 
            the linkages were constructed in SolidWorks. Members were defined with a thickness of 1.5 inches, 
            half of which was applied as offset distances to the calculated pivot locations to ensure proper 
            motion clearance and alignment. Two revolute hinge joints, one concentric joint, and one spherical 
            joint were implemented to achieve a Grübler count of one degree of freedom. SolidWorks Motion Analysis 
            was then used to compute the trajectory of the coupler endpoints.
